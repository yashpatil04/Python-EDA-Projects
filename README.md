EDA – Customer Purchase Analysis

This project analyzes customer purchase data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations to find patterns in spending behavior. It reveals that females, especially aged 26–35 and married, place the most orders and spend the most money. Top states include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, while Food, Clothing & Apparel, and Electronics & Gadgets are the leading product categories. Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
